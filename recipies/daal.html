                <p> 
                    Bengali Daal, also known as Bengali Masoor Dal, is a comforting lentil dish originating from Bengal,
                    India (now Bangladesh and West Bengal). It's typically made with red lentils (masoor dal) simmered with
                    water and flavored with panch phoron (a Bengali five-spice blend), turmeric, and sometimes chilies. The
                    daal can be simple or more elaborate, with the addition of tomatoes, onions, and fresh herbs. It's a hearty
                    and flavorful dish enjoyed with rice or roti.

                <li> 1 cup red lentils </li>
                <li> 3 cups water </li>
                <li> 1 cup onion, thinly sliced, divided </li>
                <li> 4 cloves garlic, coarsely chopped, divided </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
                <li> 1 bay leaf </li>
                <li> ¾ cup cherry tomatoes </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon soybean oil </li>
                <li> 2  tablespoons chopped cilantro </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Wash lentils in a strainer. Combine lentils and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add 1/2 of the
                    sliced onions and garlic, reserving the rest for later. Stir in turmeric, bay leaf, tomatoes, and salt. Add
                    chiles, leaving them whole to add flavor or cut in half to add heat. When mixture begins to boil, reduce heat
                    to a simmer; cook until lentils break apart and thicken slightly, about 20 minutes.                
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, in a skillet, heat vegetable oil over medium heat until oil shimmers. Add reserved sliced onions; cook
                    and stir until onion has softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking and
                    stirring until onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more. Stir in reserved garlic and cook, stirring
                    constantly, until garlic is fragrant and tender, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add onion-garlic mixture into cooked lentils and stir. Garnish with chopped cilantro.
                </li>
            </ol>
