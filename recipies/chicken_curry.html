        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
                Among the non-veg foods, chicken is the most common around the world. Bengali people aren't an exception <br> 
                to this. The most regular meat item in Bengali diet is obviously the chicken. Cooked with curry-soup in rich <br>
                spices, with sliced potatos in most cases, this is enjoyed by the Bengali people in general with rice.

                <li> 1 teaspoon curry powder </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon garam masala </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
                <li> 4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces </li>
                <li> 2 large red-skinned potatoes, chopped </li>

        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onions in the hot oil until<br>
                    translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger-garlic paste and continue cooking another 5 minutes. Reduce heat<br>
                    to medium; stir the tomatoes into the mixture and cook until the tomatoes are pulpy, 5 to 10 minutes. Season<br>
                    with the cayenne pepper, curry powder, garam masala, turmeric, and cumin; cook and stir another 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add the chicken and potatoes to the mixture in the skillet; simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes<br>
                    are tender and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro over the<br>
                    mixture and continue simmering another 10 minutes. Serve hot.
                </li>
            </ol>
