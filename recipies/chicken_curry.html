        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Bring a medium saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Stir in potatoes; cook until potatoes are tender <br>
                    but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, mash together, and set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cumin seeds and bay leaf; <br>
                    stir until fragrant and seeds are browned. Add ground beef and onions; cook until beef is browned and crumbly <br>
                    and onions are soft, about 5 to 7 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Stir in garlic and ginger. Season with salt, cumin, coriander, turmeric, chili powder, cinnamon, cardamom, and <br>
                    black pepper. Stir in the mashed potato mixture. Remove from heat and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour, or <br>
                    until cool.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Heat 1 quart of oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Mix green chile peppers into potato and beef mixture. Place approximately 1 tablespoon of the mixture <br>
                    onto each phyllo sheet. Fold sheets into triangles, pressing edges together with moistened fingers.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Lower samosas carefully into the hot oil in batches. Fry until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Transfer<br>
                    to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining samosas. Serve warm.
                </li>
            </ol>
