            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
                Among the non-veg foods, chicken is the most common around the world. Bengali people aren't an exception 
                to this. The most regular meat item in Bengali diet is obviously the chicken. Cooked with curry-soup in rich
                spices, with sliced potatos in most cases, this is enjoyed by the Bengali people in general with rice.

            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir the onions in the hot oil until
                    translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger-garlic paste and continue cooking another 5 minutes. Reduce heat
                    to medium; stir the tomatoes into the mixture and cook until the tomatoes are pulpy, 5 to 10 minutes. Season
                    with the cayenne pepper, curry powder, garam masala, turmeric, and cumin; cook and stir another 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Add the chicken and potatoes to the mixture in the skillet; simmer, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes
                    are tender and the chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 20 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro over the
                    mixture and continue simmering another 10 minutes. Serve hot.
                </li>
