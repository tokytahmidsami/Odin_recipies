        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
               Beef is the most favourite meat to most of the Bengali people. Often eaten in regular diet, this is about <br>
               a must food item on occasions like wedding, Eid or anniversary etc. The beef is cooked with rich spices <br>
               and oil as a curry. While the curry-soup is mixed with rice, people enjoy the taste of the spices and the <br>
               tenderness of the meat.

                <li> 5 green chile peppers, finely sliced </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ginger paste </li>
                <li> 3 whole cardamom seeds </li>
                <li> 2 whole cloves </li>
                <li> 1 Â½ (2 inch) cinnamon sticks </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ground coriander </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric </li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li> 2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 1-1/2-inch pieces </li>
                <li> 3 tablespoon of Soybean Oil </li>
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Heat soybean oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and<br>
                    turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the<br>
                    onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. Cook and stir<br>
                    until the garlic begins to brown, 3 to 5 more minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Mix cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, pepper, and water into the onion mixture. Simmer until most of the water<br>
                    has evaporated and the mixture has thickened.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally,<br>
                    until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
                </li>
            </ol>
