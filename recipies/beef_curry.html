            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
               Beef is the most favourite meat to most of the Bengali people. Often eaten in regular diet, this is about
               a must food item on occasions like wedding, Eid or anniversary etc. The beef is cooked with rich spices
               and oil as a curry. While the curry-soup is mixed with rice, people enjoy the taste of the spices and the
               tenderness of the meat.

        <div class="steps">
            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Heat soybean oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and
                    turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking and stirring until the
                    onion is very tender and dark brown, 15 to 20 minutes more.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Stir in the garlic, green chiles, ginger paste, cardamom seeds, cloves, and cinnamon sticks. Cook and stir
                    until the garlic begins to brown, 3 to 5 more minutes.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Mix cumin, turmeric, garlic powder, pepper, and water into the onion mixture. Simmer until most of the water
                    has evaporated and the mixture has thickened.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Stir in beef chuck pieces until coated with spice mixture; simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally,
                    until the beef is cooked through and tender, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
                </li>
            </ol>
