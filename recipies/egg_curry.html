            <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
                Bengali egg curry, also known as Dimer Dalna, is a comforting dish featuring boiled eggs and potatoes in a flavorful gravy.
                The gravy is aromatic with panch phoron (five spice blend) and mustard oil, and often includes onions, tomatoes, ginger, and
                garlic. The eggs are typically hard-boiled, then fried for a slightly crisp texture. This delicious and hearty curry is a
                Bengali classic, perfect with rice for a satisfying meal.

            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions; cook and stir until onion pieces are soft and
                    translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until onions are golden,
                    about 10 minutes more.                
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Remove pan from heat and set it aside. Transfer cooked onions to the bowl of a food processor; grind onions, tomatoes, and
                     green chiles into a smooth paste.                
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat. Add onion mixture carefully, as it may spatter. Cook
                     and stir for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, garam masala, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and
                      salt. Cook and stir until the oil begins to separate from the mixture, about 5 minutes.                
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    Pour water into skillet and bring sauce to a boil. Add cubed potatoes. Gently stir in the eggs. Reduce heat to low and simmer
                    until sauce has thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat. Garnish with cilantro before serving.
                </li>
            </ol>
